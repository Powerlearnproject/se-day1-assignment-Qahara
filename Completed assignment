# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is an engineering branch that deals with development of high quality products using well defined scientific principles and methods.
**IMPORTANCE
-It enables the creation of software applications and systems that play a crucial role in day to day living.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages.
-The establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
-The rise of agile methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements phase-This is where the user is asked what he or she expects from the software.
-Design phase-This is where high detailed software architecture is created from the user requirements.
-Development phase-This is where the actual coding of the software takes place.
-Implementation phase-This is where the developed software is implemented.
-Testing phase-This is where the developed software is tested for bugs and functionality.
-Deployment phase-This is where the software is released to the users.
-Maintenance phase-This where the software receives regular updates and support.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall model's flexibility is very rigid whereby it is difficult to accomodate change once development starts while Agile model's flexibility is very flexibile and changes can be accomodated easily during the entire development process.
-Waterfall model can be used in development of medical software because it requires thorough documentation and approval before deployment while agile model can be used in game development
because the developer can incorporate user feedback to fix issues quickly.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-A software developer is responsible for designing,coding,testing and maintaining application software.
-Quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring that software applications meet the required standards their role involves testing,identifying bugs and ensuring performance and security of the software.
-Project manager is responsible for planning,executing,managing software projects within the scope of time and budget their role involves ensuring the project goals aligns with business objectives and managing risks. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-An IDE provides tools that enhance productivity and efficiency an example is Visual studio code while A VCS allows developers to collaborate on a project and also helps developers track changes/modifications of their code an example is git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing requirements.
-Tight deadlines.
-Technical debt.
**OVERCOMING STRATEGIES
-Establishing effective communication.
-Adopting agile methodologies.
-Prioritisation of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing-this is where individual components of a program are tested to ensure that they work properly.
-Integration testing-this is where individual units of a program are tested together inorder to make sure they function properly when they are coupled together.
-System testing-this is where the entire application is tested to ensure that it meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
-Acceptance testing-this is the final phase of testing where the software is evaluated to ensure it meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
